## For those who want to get information about MFC/C++ 

I developed the project initially in 2001, and it took about two years to finish. Unfortunately, the source files don't include MySQL header files and the related libraries. I didn't touch the code since 2004. Instead, codes are solely given as an information source for those who want to know about Windows Programming with MFC, client-server architecture, DirectX, and MySQL connection from an application. 

You will see some folders inside the repository.  

- VoD - Video on Demand Windows Teacher Edition source codes
- VoDPlayer - VoD Student UI source codes
- VoDPP - VoD Player Plus, which includes online chating facility
- VoDTCPServer - VoD TCP Server source codes
- VoDUDPServer - VoD UDP Server source codes
- vodWeb - Includes necessary files for the web interface of VoD

Player versions may require DirectX libraries to be installed. SQL files are also here in the base folder. In order to run the applications, you have to install a MySQL server and import the default values.
