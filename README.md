# VoD
VoD Thesis project files, including UDP and TCP servers, player, and the editor apps.

## For those who want to get information about MFC/C++ 

I developed the project initially in 2001, and it took about two years to finish. Unfortunately, the source files don't include MySQL header files and the related libraries. I didn't touch the code since 2004. Instead, codes are solely given as an information source for those who want to know about Windows Programming with MFC, client-server architecture, DirectX, and MySQL connection from an application. 

You will see some folders inside the repository.  

- VoD - Video on Demand Windows Teacher Edition source codes
- VoDPlayer - VoD Student UI source codes
- VoDTCPServer - VoD TCP Server source codes
- VoDUDPServer - VoD UDP Server source codes

Player versions may require DirectX libraries to be installed.
